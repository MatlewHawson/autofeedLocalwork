Smaller portion of a larger "Internet-of-Things" project

More independent experimentation on/fine tuning of servo code, may include some sensor code in the future.
Code written here is written for Arduino. All libraries used will be included under "libraries" (including ones that come default with the IDE; it will be specified within the code if the library needs to be downloaded and put in Ardunio IDE's Libraries folder).
